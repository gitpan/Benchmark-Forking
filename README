NAME
    Benchmark::Forking - About the forking benchmarks distribution

MOTIVATION
    The standard Benchmark module can sometimes report inaccurate or
    misleading results, in part because it doesn't isolate its test cases
    from one another. This means that the order that cases are run in can
    influence the results, because side effects, either obvious or obscure,
    can accumulate and affect later tests.

    Data in global variables is an obvious source of side effects; in the
    below example, the grep takes longer as more items are pushed onto the
    array, so the test functions that run later will be reported by
    Benchmark as being slower, despite their code being identical:

      cmpthese( 1000, {
        "test_1" => sub { push @global, scalar grep 1, @global },
        "test_2" => sub { push @global, scalar grep 1, @global },
        "test_3" => sub { push @global, scalar grep 1, @global },
      } );

    More cryptic sources of side effects can include cache priming,
    idiosyncrasies of the underlying Perl implementation, or the state of
    the operating system and environment. For example, if the code to be
    benchmarked require a lot of in-process RAM, earlier tests may be slowed
    down by having to allocate the memory the first time, or later tests may
    be slowed down by having to pick through the heap looking for free
    space. These effects are difficult to predict and can be laborious to
    identify and compensate for.

    This module provides a solution to most aspects of this problem. Once
    you use Benchmark::Forking, the example benchmark above will report the
    correct conclusion that the three identical tests run at approximately
    the same speed.

VERSION
    This is version 1.00 of Benchmark::Forking.
